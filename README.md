# Github Review Links

This is a quick hack to generate useful review links for Github based on
tagging pull requests.

To be useful you need to use the following labels for your PRs:

- `dependencies` - for automatic updates of components created by CI, e.g.
  Dependabot
- `needs-work` - mark automatic updates for which a CI simple retry will
  not work

Then you can use the links generated by this page to simplify reviews:
